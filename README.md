# OSS Licenses Gradle Plugin

This is a fork of Google's OSS Licenses Gradle Plugin that generates a 
dependencies_with_licenses.json file, containing the information from the 
existing dependencies.json file as well as the library name and license 
information for each dependency.

This plugin does not generate the third_party_licenses or 
third_party_licenses_metadata files.
